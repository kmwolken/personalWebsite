# About Me

I am currently a Master's student in Oregon State's forest biometrics lab. My research focuses on identifying forest stands for management, employing remote sensing techniques to expand the reach and influence of traditional plot-based data acquisition. My goals are to develop knowledge and experience of environmental applications of R, remote sensing, and 'big data'. I am determined to learn how to integrate these components in a manner useful to forest management.
